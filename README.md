# YogaVishnu2
The goal of this project is to develop a brand new site for an exciting Yoga studio( Yogavishnu.se ) where customers will be able to login and see their schedules for the week after they have paid for a new offer being given in the site
I also showcase all the tools that I have been using that make up my Front End Developer workflow in this site. 
This includes using: 
1)GIT 
2)Node.js 
3) Bootstrap 4
4) Javascript 
5) React
