# YogaVishnu2
YogaVishnu.se will be using the BEM naming convention and pure CSS with no frameworks. The goal in creating this website is to Showcase all the tools that I have been using that make up my Front End Developer workflow. 
This includes using: 
1)GIT 
2)Node.js ( For server side )  
3)CSS ( Keeping it well organised and manageble for larger scaling up of the site - Will be using the BEM naming convention to facilitate this) 
4)Mobile First ( Includes Lazy loading and responsive web design ) 
5)Javascript ( With Module Pattern , OOP, Babel and Webpack) 
6) PHP
7) AWS
